##### **Invited talk by Dr. Chetan Arora on First Person Wearable Cameras- Understanding the Photographer Behaviour**
**Title Of the Talk:** First Person Wearable Cameras: Understanding the Photographer Behaviour  
**Speaker:** Dr. Chetan Arora  
**Date &Time:** Saturday, 13th July 2019 15:00-16:00  
**Venue:** Room No-LH3  

**Abstract:**

Wearable cameras like the GoPro are one of the best selling cameras these days. The always on nature and the first person point of view are the unique characteristics of such egocentric cameras giving access to the information not possible with traditional point and shoot cameras. Recognising wearer's activity is one of the core tasks in many egocentric applications. In this talk I will present some of our work in this area starting with our earlier work on long term activity recognition using traditional machine learning methods. I will then go on to explain how deep learning helped us to generalise the recognition to much larger class of activities for which designing hand tuned features was unthinkable. I will also describe some of our work to aid independent mobility of visually impaired.
