**Title:** DNS Object Exchange or Draft Durand Object Exchange  
**Speaker:** Mr. Alain Durand  
**Host Faculty:**  Dr. Bheemarjuna Reddy Tamma  
**Room No:** Auditorium  
**Time:** 16:00  
**Abstract:**

Mr. Durand published a draft at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) in December 2017 on DNS Object Exchange. Also known as the Draft Durand Object Exchange, the draft defines a Resource Record (RR) type ("OX") to implement an architecture for the exchange of digital objects using identifiers stored within the Internet’s Domain Name System (DNS).  Each OX RR contains an object type that might be opaque and private to the producer and the consumer of the data and either the data (if small enough to fit in the RR) or a pointer on how to retrieve the actual data.

The basis of this draft is being used to further the research on OX being carried out at IIT Hyderabad by a team under Dr. Bheemarjuna Reddy and Dr. Antony Franklin in collaboration with the NASSCOM Centre for Excellence for IOT and AI, New Delhi. Mr. Durand will speak about this DNS Object Exchange project and its impact on the DNS.
