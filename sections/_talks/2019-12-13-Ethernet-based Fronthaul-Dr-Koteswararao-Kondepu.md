##### **Seminar talk titled "Ethernet-based Fronthaul- A critical enabler of 5G" by Dr. Koteswararao Kondepu**
**Title Of the Talk:** Ethernet-based Fronthaul- A critical enabler of 5G  
**Speaker:** Dr. Koteswararao Kondepu  
**Date &Time:** Friday, 13th Dec 2019 10:00
**Venue:** Room No A-LH2  

**Abstract:**

5G and beyond Radio Access Network (RAN) is expected to be based on a centralized architecture where RU (radio unit) is separated from the DU (digital unit), and connected through a high-bandwidth low-latency connection, called Fronthaul (i.e., set of LTE stack functionalities in radio access part and digital processing part). Such split architecture can cater to increased traffic demand, while still maintaining low Capital and Operational expenditure (CAPEX and OPEX) by utilizing multiplexing gains and efficient resourcesharing. Encapsulating this interface on Ethernet is an attractive solution due to its cost effectiveness and ubiquity. The presentation introduces novel scheduling algorithms and the first proof of concept implementation by performing FPGA-based Verilog experimentation and simulations to verify the feasibility of Ethernet Fronthaul.  

**Speaker Profile:**  

Koteswararao Kondepu is currently working as a Senior Research Fellow at Scuola Superiore Santâ€™Anna of Pisa, Italy. He obtained his Ph.D. degree in Computer Science and Engineering from Institute for Advanced Studies Lucca (IMT), Italy in July 2012. His research interests are 5G, softwarization and virtualization of mobile network, optical networks design, wired-wireless access convergence, communication networks reliability, energy efficient schemes in communication networks and sparse sensor networks.
