##### **Seminar talk titled "Data Science in Industry: Review, Needs and Trends"**
**Title Of the Talk:** Data Science in Industry: Review, Needs and Trends  
**Speaker:** Dr. Om Deshmukh  
**Date &Time:** Wednesday, 08th Jan 2020 11:30  
**Venue:** Room No C-LH5  

**Abstract:**

In this talk I will provide a brief overview of how academic and industrial research in data science has evolved over the last two decades and its implications on the business side, in particular the centrality accorded by businesses to 'data-driven-decisioning'. This overview will help you understand and appreciate the need for a framework for developing and deploying data-science driven products. Specifically, we will talk about best practices and challenges at each stage of the data driven product development starting from (a) data gathering, cleaning and normalization, (b) incorporating domain expertise, (c) choice of model, (d) model training and evaluation, (e) design decisions for at-scale deployment, (f) planning for redundancy, (g) continuous monitoring for model deterioration, and (h) logging customer feedback. This overview will help you understand and appreciate the second part of the talk which presents some of the data-analytics algorithms that we have been building. With the latest advancements in machine learning methods and the availability of vast amount of data, there has never been a better time to build data science driven products.
