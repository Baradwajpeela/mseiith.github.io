##### **Invited Talk by Sagar Kale on Streaming Algorithms**
**Title of the Talk:** Streaming Algorithms for Matching Problems  
**Speaker:** Sagar Kale  
**Date &Time:** 18th October 2019  
**Venue:** Room No-A-119  

**Abstract:**

The advent of big data necessitated design of algorithms that could cope with it.  Streaming algorithms are viable for big data because they process their input sequentially and use a small amount of working memory.  In this talk, I will present my research on streaming algorithms for matching problems.  Matching problems have played a significant historical role in not just combinatorial optimization specifically but computer science at large and are our benchmark problems for development and understanding of a computational model. Indeed, studying them in the streaming model has led me to fastest algorithms for some combinatorial optimization problems---streaming or otherwise.  

In the maximum matching problem, edges of the input graph arrive one-by-one in the stream and the goal is to compute a matching of large size.  Weighted matching is a well-studied generalization of maximum matching where the graph is edge-weighted, and, in a further generalization, a submodular function is defined on the edges. Submodular functions have received a lot of attention in theoretical computer science as well as, more recently, in machine learning.

I will discuss a reduction from submodular matching to weighted matching that also extends to streaming algorithms for very general constraints such as matroids.  I will conclude with an overview of my other research.  

**Speaker Profile:**  

Sagar Kale did his Ph.D. at Dartmouth College where his advisor was Prof. Amit Chakrabarti.  He is currently a postdoc at EPFL where his host is Prof. Ola Svensson. His research is mainly on streaming algorithms for combinatorial optimization problems related to matchings and matroids---which are fundamental structures in computer science.
